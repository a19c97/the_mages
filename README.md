#Dude, Where's My Car?

## The Challenge
The accelerating progress in autonomous vehicle development forces us to reconsider the traditional interaction between car and passenger.  *Dude, Where's My Car?* reshapes this relationship by providing a personal touch to the driving experience.  Our app creates an enjoyable and convenient ride for passengers while fostering enhanced safety features.

## What It Does
*Dude, Where's My Car?* allows passengers to personalize exclusive features to better fit their needs.

## Features

Vehicle users create individual accounts to view and store their preferences.  Features include a home button, the ability to search for places of interest, a map, and various personalizable settings.  We additionally introduce the following technological advances:

### Safety
- **Enhanced Accessibility** offers a large home button icon to autonomously drive passengers, such as the elderly, home.

- **Learner Mode** provides safety assistance to beginning drivers such as speed monitoring, seatbelt reminders, and blinker usage.
- **Car-Phone** communication allows family members to locate their car via text message.  In conjunction with Learner Mode, this system can also message parents when their teen is steadily speeding.

### Entertainment
- **Favorite Places** searches for food, ATMs, car repair shops, and gas stations near your location and remembers places you have previously visited.
