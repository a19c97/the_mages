# DUDE, _Where's My Car?_

# Dynamic User Driving Enhancement

## 1. The Challenge

The accelerating progress in autonomous vehicle development forces us to reconsider the traditional interaction between car and passenger.  **DUDE** reshapes this relationship by providing a personal touch to the driving experience.  Our app creates an enjoyable and convenient ride for passengers while fostering enhanced safety features.

## 2. Main Features

Vehicle users create individual accounts to view and store their tailored preferences that toggle specific app functions.

### 2.1 Go Home

- The uniquely designed **Go Home** button automatically directs the user home through Google Maps. In fully autonomous cars, this function has the potential of transporting the user home safely with utmost convenience.

## 3. Addressing Demographics

Our app's functionality is tailored to other kinds of users.

### 3.1 Teenagers

- The **Speed Warning** function allows the car to send text messages to a specified phone number if the car is exceeding the current road's speed limit as dictated by Google Maps.

- The **Location Monitoring** option allows the car the text its geographical position to a 
specified phone number over intervals of time.

### 3.2 The Elderly

- **Enhanced Accessibility** alters the user interface to better fit visual needs.

### 3.3 Learners

- **Learner Mode** provides safety assistance to beginning drivers such as speed monitoring, 
seat belt reminders, and blinker usage, which is done through keeping track of the various 
turning and signal behaviours of the car.
