## The Challenge
The accelerating progress in autonomous vehicle development forces us to reconsider the traditional interaction between car and passenger.  *Dude, Where's My Car?* reshapes this relationship by providing a personal touch to the driving experience.  Our app creates an enjoyable and convenient ride for passengers while fostering enhanced safety features.

## What It Does
*Dude, Where's My Car?* allows passengers to personalize exclusive features to better fit their needs.

## Features

Vehicle users create individual accounts to view and store their preferences.  Features include a home button, the ability to search for places of interest, a map, and various personalizable settings.  We additionally introduce the following technological advances:

### Safety
- **Enhanced Accessibility** offers a large home button icon to autonomously drive passengers, such as the elderly, home.

- **Learner Mode** provides safety assistance to beginning drivers such as speed monitoring, seatbelt reminders, and blinker usage.
- **Car-Phone** communication allows family members to locate their car via text message.  In conjunction with Learner Mode, this system can also message parents when their teen is steadily speeding.

The Pitch


Our app provides a personalized touch to your GM driving experience.

Every family member has their own personal assistant that are tuned to their personal preferences and needs.

For instance, the "grandma" account would have larger font sizes and fewer options on each page. 

Scalability


Portability - car sharing

Can log into the personal account on any GM vehicle
